    <section id="About"><h1>Going to the park!</h1><p>Parks provide an excellent place for people to come together to walk, run, climb and play in the fresh air. And the benefits of this are huge. Whether it’s a ParkRun on the weekends, an evening game of five-a-side with jumpers for goalposts, or taking your dog for a walk, parks help us keep our bodies and minds happy and healthy. Research by the University of Exeter suggests that access to good-quality green space is linked to feeling healthier, a lower body mass index and decreased levels of obesity, and improved mental health and wellbeing. Since the National Lottery started investing in Parks for People 20 years ago, the number of annual visitors has increased by 8million. That’s a lot more people getting outside and improving their health and wellbeing.</p></section>
